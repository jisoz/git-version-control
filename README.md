git config --global user.name ""
git config --global user.email ""

git config --list


<!-- The git config --global user.name "" and git config --global user.email "" commands in Git are used to set your global username and email address, respectively. These values are important because Git uses them to record the author of commits. Here's why you need to configure these settings:

Identification: Every commit in Git has information about who made the changes. The user.name and user.email settings allow Git to properly attribute the work to you.
Global Configuration: Using the --global flag ensures that these settings apply to all repositories on your system. You can also set them on a per-repository basis without the --global flag if needed.
Consistency: Setting these configurations helps maintain consistent author information across all your repositories, making it easier to track contributions and manage code changes. -->
